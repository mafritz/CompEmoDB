    "text": "A scheme in a NoSQL database is a data model that define the structure of entries. Contrary to SQL/rectangular data structure, each entry can have its own scheme, different from other entries. In terms of componential emotions, a scheme is therefore the structure of key-values pairs that determine what kind of components and features within component an entry has.\nWhen multiple entries are meant to share the same structure, it is possible to explicit a scheme so that the desired structure can be forced upon entries. The scheme may nevertheless still be flexible, for some elements can be defined as optional.\nAt the same time, schemes can also be harnessed to help the constitution of entries, since they can be integrated in text-editors. In this way, the schema can be used to suggest or auto-complete code when creating new entries.\nThe main idea is therefore for researchers to build consensual schemes that are representative of emotion theories or frameworks. Emotion entries into the CompEmoDB will then be structured according to the decided scheme."

    "text": "Componential theories posit that emotion elicitation and differentiation result from the synchronization of several subsystems such as cognitive, motivational, physiological, motor expression, and experiential. Theories differ, though, in (1) the nature of the synchronization, such as causal, associative, or connectionist (Barrett, 2017; Scherer, 2019; Suri & Gross, 2022); and (2) the kind of components and features within them (e.g. evaluative criteria, lexicalized emotions). Attempts to characterize emotions with componential profiles must therefore face the sheer number of possible combinations. For instance, the GRID system (Fontaine et al., 2013) provides 142 columns-like features shared by every row representing a discrete emotion. A rectangular data representation, though, forces a profile that is difficult to fit and scale to a wide variety of emotion structures. It may thus be worth investigating the feasibility and interest for a collective, theory-agnostic, and loosely structured database of componential emotions in which entries can leverage on more flexible data structures provided by NoSQL databases. These structures present the following advantages: (1) entries don’t have to provide the same number or kind of components and features; (2) the structure can be nested, for components to be sub-organized in more fine-grained criteria, including multiple and alternative options; and (3) entries can be augmented by multi-modal features such as images, videos, or sounds. The many potential applications of the database include measures of distance/similarity between emotions, computable both from the structure and values of entries, or complex queries adopted to retrieve richer profiles from partial inputs."
